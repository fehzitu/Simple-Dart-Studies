// { INTRODUCTION }

/*
Here I will clarify the fundamentals we must master to consider ourselves good at Dart and consequently at Flutter as well.
I'll tell you upfront that there will be 12 steps and an extra tip that will make all the difference in Dart & Flutter programming.
Of course, everything is documented and explained with examples here in this repository, and in order to facilitate learning.

Let's get started!
*/

// { STEP 1: FUNDAMENTALS OF LANGUAGE }

/*
1 - TYPES AND VARIABLES
  - First you need learn declaration and explicit types
  (var, final and const and explicit types, int, double, string and bool)
  - Difference between final (immutable, but initialized at runtime) and const (constant at compile time)
  - Dynamic types (dynamic, Object?)
*/

// { STEP 2: FLOW CONTROL }

/*
1 - Flow control
  - Structures like if, else if, switch, for, while, do-while
  - And the use of break, continue and return
*/

// { STEP 3: FUNCTIONS }

/*
1 - Essential Functions
  - Declaration and return
  - Named and positional parameters
  - Anonymous and arrow functions
  - Closures (internal functions that "remember" the external scope)
*/

// { STEP 4: NULL SAFETY }

/*
? → variable can be zero
! → states that it is not zero
?? → default value if it is zero
??= → assigns a value if it is zero
