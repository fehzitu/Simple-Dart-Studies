// { STEP 1: WHERE I CAN USE DART? }

/*
Dart is a language similar to Javascript and is used on the server side. Therefore, we can run Dart on our machine normally, but there are some specific points to consider when programming it.
*/

// { ONLINE }

/*
If you wantto program something faster and simpler, you can simply program in an online editor. Here are 2 links that I used.

Code Dart online:
- DartPad:
  https://dartpad.dev/?theme=dark
- One Compiler:
  https://onecompiler.com/dart

Note that online editors do not support libraries and frameworks.
*/

// { INSTALLED }

/*
Now, if you want to program long-term, I recommend installing an IDE or an application focused on that. This is the most common case, after all, Dart is also a very robust and complete language.

To get straight to the point, you can proceed with installing Dark on your machine in a few different ways, and here I'll show you the most commonly used ones.

- Dart SDK:
  https://dart.dev/get-dart
- Dart IDE's:
  https://dart.dev/tools#editors

The most widely used is VSCODE, which runs the language natively, but we still recommend using the Dart extension.
